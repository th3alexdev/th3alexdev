## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on

I'm currently working on a browser extension called SmartType. The extension allows users to create custom commands that automatically expand into predefined text snippets. SmartType aims to provide users with a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks by creating custom commands. Other of the main use cases for SmartType is prompts storage conmmonly used in working with AI, such ``//showSocialMedia``, ``//improveWriting``, or ``//doResume``, which expands into a pre-saved prompt, it can also be utilized to streamline various other tasks.

Some of the features I'm implementing include:
 - [x] User-friendly interface for managing commands and their expansions.
 - [x] Customizable shortcuts for triggering the expansions.
 - [x] Support for dynamic variables within expansions for personalized content.
 - [x] Import and export functionality to easily share commands with others.
 - [x] Cross-browser compatibility to cater to a wide range of users.

With Text Expander, users will have the power to automate their workflows, save time, and enhance their productivity by eliminating repetitive typing tasks.
